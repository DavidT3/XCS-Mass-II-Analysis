    "<span style=\"color:red\">This section of the project explores potential reasons and diagnostics of galaxy cluster/group scaling relation scatter using the new SDSSRM-XCS relations constructed in this work from the properties measured in the first paper of this series [(Turner et al. 2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.tmp...10T/abstract).\n",

    "Here we use several relations to investigate whether there are obvious correlations between the scatter-from-expected-values of individual data points and whether the galaxy cluster/group that they represent had a targeted XMM observation or if the data were serendipitous. Separating clusters into targeted and serendipitous was an approach taken for the SDSSRM-XCS sample by [Giles et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3878G/abstract) when examining $L_{\\rm{X}}$-$T_{\\rm{X}}$ relations. They found that distinctly different relations when treating the two 'classes' independently. \n",
